! Local Preferences:
! We prefer traffic via customers (thay pay for it), otherwise via peers, 
! and via providers only as a last resort (since we pay for that)
! 75  custom (lowered) preference, may be configured by customers, peers or providers using community 2075
! 80  providers (low preference)
! 85  custom (lowered) preference, may be configured by customers or peers using community 2085
! 90  peers (medium preference)
! 95  custom (lowered) preference, may be configured by customers using community 2095
! 100 customers (high preferences)

! Communities:
! We allow neighbours to announce routing entries to use with a community value that signifies 
! that it is a low-preference route. This can be useful for backup connections which are not 
! to be used unless there really is no other option. We never allow neighbours to set a higher 
! preference: that is something we decide upon. The reason we graciously allow lower preferences 
! is that we rather receive announcements with low preference than no announcement at all.
! 2:2075  (as sent by others): request to set local preference to 75
! 2:2085  (as sent by others): request to set local preference to 85
! 2:2095  (as sent by others): request to set local preference to 95
